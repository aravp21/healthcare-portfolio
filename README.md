## Healthcare Portfolio 

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed EDA on 5 Kaggle medical datasets for stroke, liver cirrhosis, and breast cancer prediction as well as COVID-19 forecasting and diabetic retinopathy detection to gain understanding of underlying factors for each use case. Experimented with different data visualization and modeling techniques to further extract insights from the data.

### Topic Modeling
Web scraped daily headline data from 12 top health news sources to analyze trends in the medical industry. Utilized latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) and related visualization packages to perform topic modeling and also relied on several keyword extraction models to identify buzz words for further inference of trending topics.

### Infection Cell Automata Simulation
Modeled spread of common contagious illnesses with simple cell automata simulation based on SIR model with modifiable parameters. Developed basic underlying probability distribution to model spread of disease from one individual to another.
